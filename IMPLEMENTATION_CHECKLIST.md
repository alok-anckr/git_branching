  ```bash
  git checkout -b develop
  git push -u origin develop
  ```

- [ ] **Create `staging` branch**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b staging
  git push -u origin staging
  ```

- [ ] **Verify branches exist**
  ```bash
  git branch -r
  # Should show: origin/main, origin/develop, origin/staging
  ```

### Step 1.2: Set Default Branch (Optional)

- [ ] Consider keeping `main` as default
- [ ] Or change to `develop` for development-focused workflow
  - Go to Settings > Branches > Default branch

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: GitHub Actions Setup

### Step 2.1: Commit Workflow Files
